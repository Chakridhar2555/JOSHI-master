## What is Taipy REST

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our
[website](https://www.taipy.io). Taipy is split into multiple repositories including
_taipy-core_ and _taipy-rest_ to let users install the minimum they need.

Taipy Core mostly includes business-oriented
features. It helps users create and manage business applications and improve analyses
capability through time, conditions and hypothesis.

Taipy REST is a set of APIs built on top of the
_taipy-core_ library developed by Avaiga. This project is meant to be used as a complement
for **taipy** and its goal is to enable automation through rest APIs of processes built
on taipy.

The project comes with rest APIs that provide interaction with all of taipy modules:
 - DataNodes
 - Tasks
 - Jobs
 - Sequences
 - Scenarios
 - Cycles

A more in depth documentation of taipy can be found [here](https://docs.taipy.io).
